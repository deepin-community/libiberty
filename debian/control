Description: library of utility functions used by GNU programs
 The libib library is a collection of subroutines used by various
 GNU programs, which are missing or broken on some systems.
 .
 This library shouldn't be used by other software, but unfortunately
 already is. There is no guaranty for a stable library API, and no
 shared library is provided.
